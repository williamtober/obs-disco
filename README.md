# obs-disco
obs-disco is a web based stream overlay for OBS or StreamLabs. Objectively I'd like to has all expected events for streams mapped and setup.

## Resources
obs disco uses [twitch-js](https://github.com/twitch-js/twitch-js) and [nyan-cat](https://github.com/twitch-js/twitch-js) for functionality and testing purposes.

## MVP Goal
The minimum goal is to get chat working with the custom overlay.

## Forward Plan
Add custom event handler for multiple events i.e. subscriptions, follows, bit donations, hypetrains etc etc
